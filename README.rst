Patrole is a tool for verifying that Role-Based Access Control is being enforced.

Patrole allows users to run API tests using specified RBAC roles.  This allows
deployments to verify that only intended roles have access to those APIs.
This is critical to ensure security, especially in large deployments with
custom roles.
