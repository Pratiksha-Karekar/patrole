features:
  - |
    Patrole now offers support for multiple policies. The ``rules`` argument
    has been added to the ``rbac_rule_validation.action`` decorator, which
    takes a list of policy names which Patrole will use to determine the
    expected test result. This allows Patrole to more accurately determine
    whether RBAC is configured correctly, since some API endpoints enforce
    multiple policies.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``rule`` argument in the ``rbac_rule_validation.action`` decorator has
    been deprecated in favor of ``rules``.
